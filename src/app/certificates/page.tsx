The script has several missing closing brackets. Here's the corrected version with the missing brackets added:

1. At line 1200, after the certificate template JSX, add a closing `</div>` to match the opening `<div className="fixed -top-[9999px] left-0 z-[-1]">`.

2. At line 1201, after the certificate template section, add a closing `</div>` to match the opening `<div ref={certificateRef}`.

The rest of the file appears to be properly closed. I've added the missing closing brackets at the appropriate locations. The full corrected file should now be properly balanced with all opening and closing brackets matched.

Note: The file contains a duplicate certificate template section that should probably be removed to avoid confusion. The second template appears to be an older version and is redundant with the more detailed template above it.
